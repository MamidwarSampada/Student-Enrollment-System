     assign schedules and sections, and monitor enrollment requirements.

      education institutions has been proposed, which includes competition among entrants 
      and the use of data on entrants to allocate places. An enrollment system for compulsory
       education based on a government administration big data platform and intelligent position
        dispatching has been developed to ensure fair enrollment opportunities. A self-enrollment 
        system has been designed to automate the management of student enrollment, ensuring stability, 
        network load management, and ease of system maintenance. An enrollment management system and process
         have been developed to track and analyze data on prospective students, facilitate decision-making, and
